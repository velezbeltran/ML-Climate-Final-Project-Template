The last week was mostly about exploration. Though initially, I knew that working on Tracking Carbon Emission would be my goal for this semester, I didn't really arrive at how I was going to achieve it. Machine Learning of course is one fascinating topic that I would be prepared work with countless hours. I was looking for a sector to apply this to. My background is in Electrical Engineering and I have done quite a lot with energy per se, Hence working with energy again would be interesting. I skimmed through the internet for datasets, looked for meaningful data and found the website which is " ourworldindata". It is an interesting website and I am looking forward to working with the data I obtained from there.
